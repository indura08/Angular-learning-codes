Starting from Angular version 17, the default project setup no longer includes the app.module.ts file. This change is due to the introduction of "Standalone Components" in Angular 14.

Here's why Angular made this shift:

Simplified Application Structure: Standalone components remove the need for modules, resulting in a cleaner and less boilerplate-heavy application structure.

Improved Developer Experience: With standalone components, you can focus on writing components without having to worry about setting up modules and providers.
However, if you're more comfortable with the traditional module-based approach, here are two ways to bring back the app.module.ts file:


1.Using the --no-standalone Flag:

When creating a new Angular project using the Angular CLI, you can specify the --no-standalone flag to explicitly disable the standalone components setup. This will generate a project with the familiar app.module.ts file.

"ng new my-project --no-standalone"
