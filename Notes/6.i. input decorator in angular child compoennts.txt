hodt mathk thiygnna with input : the information flows from parent to child

IThink of @Input() in Angular like passing a note between friends in school

Here's where @Input() comes into play:

1.TThe Sender (Child Component):
Imagine you have a friend (let's call them "Child").
This friend has some cool information (let's call it message) written on a piece of paper.
They want to share this information with another friend (let's call them "Parent")..

2.The Receiver (Parent Component):
You have another friend (let's call them "Parent").
Your friend "Child" wants to give you their note (message) so you can see it.

Here's how @Input() works:

Your friend "Child" writes their message on a piece of paper and puts it in an envelope labeled "Input".
They give you the envelope with their message inside.
Because you're expecting to receive messages from your friend "Child", you know to check the envelope labeled "Input".
You take out the note (message) from the envelope and read it. Now you know what your friend "Child" wanted to share with you.


In this analogy:

The friend who wants to share the information (Child Component) uses @Input() to label the message.
The friend who receives the information (Parent Component) knows to look for the labeled envelope (@Input()).

So, @Input() is like passing a note (data) from one friend (Child Component) to another friend (Parent Component) in school. It helps components communicate and share information with each other.

Q. so is input decortaor is a reference to parent component that this data was sent by the child compoent?

A. 

1.Child Component (Sender):
The child component defines an @Input() property to indicate that it expects to receive data from its parent component.
This property can be of any data type: string, number, object, array, etc.
By decorating a property with @Input(), the child component signals to Angular that this property will accept input from its parent.

2.Parent Component (Receiver):
In the parent component's template, when using the child component, you can bind to the @Input() property of the child component.
By binding to the @Input() property, you're passing data from the parent component to the child component.
Whatever value you assign to the @Input() property in the parent component will be received and used by the child component.


So, in summary, the @Input() decorator is more of a marker or indicator used by Angular to establish a communication channel from the parent component to the child component. It's not a direct reference to the parent component, but rather a way for the child component to declare that it can receive data from its parent.
